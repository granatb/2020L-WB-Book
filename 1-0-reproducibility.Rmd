# Reproducibility of scientific papers {#reproducibility}

This chapter contains a wide range of studies on the reproducibility of scientific articles.
Each subsection is a self-contained paper answering a different research problem.

Please, note that each subsection contains a work of different authors and therefore subsections may differ at some points, for example, definitions of reproducibility used in particular studies.
